## Too Long To Read
Jobby is a central reporting hub for autonomous tasks and jobs that are executed on a regular schedule. For example, backup scripts that run every day send a report whether they did their job successfully, incorrectly or not at all. The latter information is obtained by the absence of the report.

## Motivation
Some people probably know the problem: You are a developer or a server administrator and you have several servers or applications that you have to maintain. Now one and the other application or server has jobs that are regularly executed autonomously. For example a backup script, or a task that cleans up the database of an application. Usually these jobs run silently in the background and the Developer/Admin is not informed whether the job was executed successfully or failed.

Jobby is a self-host platform that can be considered as a report centre. The idea is that when a cronjob has finished, it forwards its status to Jobby. The user then gets an overview of all his distributed jobs in the jobby dashboard.

## Setup
### Techstack
- The Backend is built with Python using the [Django-Rest-Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
- The Frontend is based on [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/)
- Database [PostreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- And ofcourse [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is involved.

## Usage
### Entities
- Job
    - A job is a task or a job that is executed. "Backup server Foobarbaz" for instance.
- JobGroup
    - Jobgroup can be used to group up Jobs. For example: 'Backup', 'Pruning'
- Host
    - The host on which the job is executed.
- HostGroup
    - A grouping of hosts. For example, "Production Servers", "Testing Servers"
- Report
    - A report from a job. A report is created when the generated snippet is executed by a job.

## Administration
#### Create User
The backend is written in Python (Django). In order to create an initial-admin user, we have to do following steps:


![](https://imgur.com/9KcmSVg.gif)


1. ``` docker-compose exec api-master bash```
2. ``` python mange.py createsuperuser```
3. Enter your credentials


#### Admin View
Use the built-in admin-view of powered by Django to manage your models.
Visit http://localhost:4800/admin and enjoy!


## Backup & Restore
In order to create a full backup, you need to create a backup of the used postgres-instance. In the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) above, its already persisted by the bind-volume. Alternatively, you can also create a usual psql-dump.
